# ForecastFlow 🌦️

**ForecastFlow** — just another weather app in my stack of weather apps. I keep making them because I enjoy it, and I don’t care if you like it or not. Built with **React Native**, it does the job. That’s it.

## What It Does

- 🌍 **Weather Check**: Your place or anywhere else, it’s there.  
- 📍 **Location**: Finds where you are or lets you pick a spot.  
- ⏰ **Future Weather**: Shows hour-by-hour and day-by-day stuff.
